Exercises in MAT1100, MAT-INF1100 and INF1100 at University of Oslo.

# NOTE!

UiO has very strict policies on copying and source material usage, so it can have fairly dire consequences for students to copy from this repository. You will be caught cheating for sure, as they have discovered other students doing this, so don't even think about it! You should only skim through my solutions and then write your own without looking.
